# streamlargefile

I follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82oFmY-Qeok

for stream large file because we don't want copy all file content to RAM.

and then i just want to try broadcast to all node.

terminal tab1: `make client1`

terminal tab2: `make client2`

terminal tab3: `make server`

terminal tab4: `make clean` [ for delete folder just created. ]

NOTE: if error use `make clean` first
